# He noted the PIN 1357, but he also said, it is possible that each of the digits he saw could actually be another adjacent digit (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally). E.g. instead of the 1 it could also be the 2 or 4. And instead of the 5 it could also be the 2, 4, 6 or 8.

# Can you help us to find all those variations? It would be nice to have a function, that returns an array of all variations for an observed PIN with a length of 1 to 8 digits.
